Servicenow has very powerful set of widgets on portal to allow users to see various records in single view.
However, I came across multiple times that, user wants to have old school "Home Page" interface, where user can see interact with charts too.
Servicenow has an OOTB widget called reports which does this automatically, however, this widget takes user to native/console view.<br/>
Well, this could be a problem in several cases like, if Organization doesn't allow end users to land on native view.

I have modified the report widget so, now this widget can be used to give a "Home page" like experience with portal drill down support.

Refer below screenshots.<br/>
